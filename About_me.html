      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Shivansh Kukreti, and I am thrilled to welcome you to my "About Me" page. I am a passionate and aspiring web developer, eager to make a mark in the ever-evolving world of technology.
      </p>
       
      <h2>My Journey into Engineering and Web-development</h2>
      <p> 
        My journey in the world of web development began with curiosity and a strong desire to create and innovate. I quickly fell in love with the art of crafting stunning websites that not only look aesthetically pleasing but also deliver seamless user experiences. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have become my canvas, and I continually strive to expand my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.
        Throughout my learning journey, I have embarked on exciting projects that have allowed me to put my web development skills to the test. From creating interactive games like the coin toss and rock-paper-scissors to building practical applications such as a weather app and cart-based menu, I have thoroughly enjoyed the creative process and problem-solving that each project entails.
      </p>

      <h2>Continuous Learning and Growth</h2>
      <p>
        As a lifelong learner, I am always hungry for knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the web development industry. I believe that staying curious and embracing new challenges is the key to personal and professional growth.
        Beyond the realm of web development, I have a flair for creativity and enjoy exploring different avenues. From editing stunning visuals with Adobe Lightroom to crafting engaging videos using Adobe Premiere Pro, I find joy in unleashing my creativity across various platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not busy coding, you can find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and flavors. Cooking is not only a stress-reliever for me but also a wonderful way to connect with others over delicious meals. Additionally, I am an avid gamer and enjoy strategic games that test my problem-solving skills and push me to think critically.
